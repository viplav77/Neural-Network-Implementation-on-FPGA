## nn_MNIST.py 
This is a Python script that defines and trains a simple neural network. It saves the trained neural network weights as .txt files.

## nn_uart.py
This is another Python script that randomly selects a test image from a dataset and sends it via UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to a  C application running on a PYNQ-Z1 board environment.

## Note
After training Neural Network Weights need to be changed for layer1, layer2, and layer3 respectively to perform inference in Xilinx HLS.
