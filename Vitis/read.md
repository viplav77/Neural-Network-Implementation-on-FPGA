## Pynq_application.c:
This is a C application designed for the PYNQ-Z1 CPU. It initializes Block RAM (BRAM) and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) on the PYNQ-Z1 board. The application receives test images over UART from a host PC and stores them in BRAM. These images are intended to be read by the FPGA for further processing.
